* Norg Example

  This is an example of an inline highlighted code chunk. It's supported in the next
  version of the Neorg TS Parser, but it's not implemented in the current one. I'm
  just leaving this here to see how this plugin will handle it in the future.
  I can add `print('attached modifier extensions')`(lang:lua) text around the code.

** Code

   @code lua
   print("Hello, Norg!")
   @end

   @code python
   print("Hello world!")
   import numpy as np
   x = np.zeros(10)
   @end

** Other things

   This is a paragraph.

   - This is a list
   -- with two indents
   ~ and a numbered item

   This is another paragraph.
